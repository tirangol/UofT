# University of Toronto
A collection of notes from my time studying undergrad computer science at the University of Toronto.

I collected my notes into:
- **Guides:** Complete, textbook-like summaries of courses meant for others to learn from
- **Notes:** Complete notes not formatted for others to learn from
- **Partial Notes:** Incomplete notes

My philosophy is that textbooks should be as concise as possible - no half-page-long paragraphs and no super-long examples.
The professor's lecture should take students on a "journey"; not the textbook.
