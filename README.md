## Notes
A collection of notes from my time studying undergrad computer science at the University of Toronto.

You will see:
- **Guides:** Complete, textbook-like summaries of courses meant for others to learn from
- **Notes:** Complete notes not necessarily formatted for others to learn from
- **Partial Notes:** Incomplete notes

My philosophy is that textbooks should be as concise as possible - no half-page-long paragraphs and no super out-of-topic applications.
The professor's lecture should be inspiring, talk about applications and take students on a "journey"; not the textbook.


## Side Projwcts
A collection of side projects I programmed at my time at the University of Toronto.
